# Project-Activity
The application domain involves the creation of a system that is capable of receiving and processing a stream of information generated by a temperature sensor.

Analyzing it in more detail, it is characterized by:

* **Temperature sensor**: it corresponds to the source of the stream which. It collects information on the temperature of the surrounding environment and sends them via Mqtt to the message broker. Since I haven't a real sensor, I would simulate it through a script written in python which, based on the 'Eclipse paho' library, it allows me to send customizable Mqtt messages through a special configuration file.

* **Message Broker**: intermediary that receives the messages from the temperature sensor and forwards them to the various subscribers. RabbitMQ was used as a message broker, which has a plugin that enables support for the Mqtt protocol for exchanging messages.

* **Temperature Service**: microservice that takes care of receiving sensor data via Spring Cloud Stream, a framework used to create highly scalable  event-driven microservices with shared messaging systems. Once you get the messages, it saves them in appropriate files through the Logback logging framework included in Spring and warns the user by sending an email when the sensor exceeds a certain threshold. Finally, it offers the possibility to set various parameters such as, for example, the email or the threshold over which the notification must be sent.

* **ApiGateway**: Spring Cloud component that takes care of receiving requests from different clients and forwards them to the appropriate microservice. In this case it exposes an interface accessible via the Rest protocol with which the configuration parameters of the Temperature Service can be changed.
This software module ensures correct isolation between external applications and the internal architecture of the sensor monitoring system.

* **Discovery Service**: component that keeps track of the information of all the services that are performing within the system, in the specific IP address and port of each.</br>
